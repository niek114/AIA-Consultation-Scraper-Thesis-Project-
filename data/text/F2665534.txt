Initiative
Artificial intelligence – ethical and legal requirements

As a company that focuses on AI powered healthcare, working in research and commercial projects that involve partners from all over Europe, we applaud the ambitious initiative of creating a EU-wide regulatory framework. After consultation of the feedback given by different actors in this field, we do not see anything that we could add. We would like to however point out the importance of closely involving companies 'on the ground' in the development of this framework, to assure its feasibility, and will be happy to provide our input in such consultations.
