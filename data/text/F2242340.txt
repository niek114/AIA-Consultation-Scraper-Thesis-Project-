Artificial intelligence – ethical and legal requirements

Unfortunately, standardisation measures are still not very common in the life sciences R&D. In the same time, more and more AI solutions are finding their way into life science research and development. Therefore, standardisation between AI and the life sciences should be harmonised too.  A note should be included on the necessity of harmonisation with standardisation measures in the field of natural sciences when AI solutions enters lifesciences R&D.
